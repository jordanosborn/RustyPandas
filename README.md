# Rusty Pandas

##### MIT License - 2019 Jordan Osborn

A general purpose mathematics library for Rust.
This package is not focused on performance however performance will not be sacrificed if possible. It is designed to be a self contained package, with a consistent and easy to use API. It should mainly find use during stages of exploratory mathematics.

## Very early stage of development

### In-Progress
1. Data-Frames and series implementing the pandas api (as close as possible)

### Future
Will eventually contain most common mathematical utilities:

1. Fourier Transforms
1. Linear Algebra
1. Tensors
1. Optimisation
1. Curve fitting
1. Root finding
1. Symbolic mathematics
1. Big integers and floats
1. Complex numbers
1. Fixed Point mathematics
1. Integration - Calculus
1. ODE Solvers
1. Graphing
1. Statistical methods
1. Machine learning, deep learning
1. Geometry
1. Data scraping
1. GPU support
1. Maths frontend
1. etc.
1. Full documentation and test suite
